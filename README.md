# Intro

Pomelo is a graphic interactive program for creating 3D meshes of text. The resulting mesh may be exported as a STL file, e.g. for importing into Blender for further processing.

# Overview 

Pomelo works by a two phase algorithm:

1. Creation of a [Straight Skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_skeleton)
2. Creation of the mesh based on the straight skeleton, and the choosen profile.

# Profiles

Pomelo supports two types of profiles:

1. The round profile, creates a round edge, smoothing the transition vertical to horizontal with a round radius.
2. Through a Bezier based profile editor, that allow creating multiple profiles that are inserted on top of one another.

# Smoothing

The straight skeleton's sometimes create sharp and ugly geometry. This may be partly mitigated 
by turning on Settings/Smoothing option, which inserts additional nodes in the skeleton. However, the smoothing may itself create other artifacts.
